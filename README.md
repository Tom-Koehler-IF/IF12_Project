# Steps to install
## Install SQL
Under SQL/Final SQL Script you can find a SQLFinal.sql. This can be installed into the mysql server.

## Setup PHP
In the http folder you can find the required contents for the htdoc / apache2 folder. Just copy the content, the database configuration should be right by default.

Eventually if you encounter some problems you need to enable the mysqli feature in the php.ini as it is required for this software.
